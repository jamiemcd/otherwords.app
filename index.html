            <h2 class="f3 b lh-title mb2">The word guessing game you play with four or more people</h2>
            <p>You are the wordsmith. Get your teammates to say the phrase — but remember, you can only use other words.
            </p>
            <p>It's super fun! And unlike pass–and–play games, each player has the Other Words app running on
                their iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch.</p>
            <p>If you've enjoyed classic board games such as <a
                    href="https://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-A4626-Taboo-Board-Game/dp/B00D4NJSBW">Taboo</a>,
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-B7389F01-Catch-Phrase-Game/dp/B01BOV6566">Catch Phrase</a>, or
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-Gaming-B0638-Guesstures-Game/dp/B00NQQU0O6">Guesstures</a>, then
                you already know the basics of how to play. Other Words has some important differences though.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Every player runs the app on their own device.</li>
                <li>The wordsmith can share any word guessed correctly and it will be shown on everyone's screen. This
                    allows for phrases longer than one or two words — similar to the gameshow <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_of_Fortune_(American_game_show)">Wheel of Fortune</a>.
                </li>
                <li>Common words such as "the", "it", and "is" are automatically shared.</li>
                <li>The opposing team can challenge and everyone casts their vote to determine if a rule was broken.
                </li>
                <li>The timer can be set for 60, 75, or 90 seconds.</li>
                <li>You can choose 1, 2, or 3 rounds.</li>
                <li>Have kids versus parents by enabling the separate phrase packs per team feature.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Of course, the best way to demonstrate is with an actual video of gameplay (coming soon).</p>
